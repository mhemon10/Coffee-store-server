**Project Overview: Coffee Store (Server-Side)**

The server-side of this application serves as the robust backbone for the Coffee Store, handling data persistence, API routing, and database management. It is built using Node.js and Express.js, providing a RESTful API that communicates seamlessly with the React frontend and a MongoDB database.

**Key Features**

RESTful API Endpoints: Structured routes to handle GET (fetching coffee), POST (adding new items), PUT (updating details), and DELETE (removing items).

Database Integration: Utilizes MongoDB and its MongoDB Driver for efficient NoSQL data storage and retrieval.

CORS & Middleware: Configured with cors and dotenv to ensure secure cross-origin requests and protected environment variables.

Dynamic Data Handling: Uses ObjectIDs for precise document targeting during update and delete operations.

**Tech Stack**

Runtime: Node.js

Framework: Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Tools: Dotenv (Environment Security), Nodemon (Development), Cors.
